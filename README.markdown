Notice:

It has recently come to my attention that tip4commit is trying to ram a Bitcoin service down GitHub project maintainers throats even though they don't want it and did not ask for it. The issue here has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself so don’t go bashing me or the FPA on that account. The FPA is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3 or later license. This license is specifically NOT a permission-less license and that doesn't mean you don't need permission to inflict 'innovation' or a ‘service’ on people that didn't ask for it, don't want it and can't opt out of it. 

The FPA is a purely volunteer project. If anyone wishes to contribute to FPA, they may do so freely and without any requirement or expectation of any type of monetary donations to the FPA project, either directly or indirectly through some ‘service’. The FPA project maintainers are not involved with the FPA projects' listing on tip4commit and any Bitcoin donations that may appear on tip4commit will not be accepted by the FPA project.  

The idea behind tip4commit: support open source projects with donations may be with good intentions, however there are a tremendous number of great ideas that are terribly implemented in the Crypto-currency space, and tip4commit is one of them. When you search for a particular project on the tip4commit site, that's when it gets added automatically to the list of projects users can donate to. That's a terrible way to do it. People accidentally add projects without knowing they are doing it, including project maintainers trying to see if their project has been added against their wishes, which it will be.

How tip4commit should work is that a project can only be added by the maintainer, and the maintainer has some control over the project's tip4commit listing. Allowing project maintainers to opt-out of the tip4commit is the very least of what tip4commit should be doing. Currently tip4commit is refusing to do this.

**_Again we are not associated in anyway with tip4commit and will NOT accept any monetary amounts from the tip4commit FPA listing._** 

**_We are also not associated with any other similar projects current or future that may solicit monetary amounts in any manner, in any form on our behalf without our explicit control or explicit knowledge and approval._**

The **_Forum Post Assistant_** has been designed to assist newcomers to the forum to be able to post relevant system, instance, php and troubleshooting information directly in to a pre-formatted forum post. This should save a few hours of too'ing and fro-ing asking for, and explaining, how to acquire useful information in order to help troubleshoot a problem.
***

This process also means that consistent information is gathered and presented in every case, enabling helpers to quickly target information relevant to the specific problem observed by the user.

The idea is to make the information collection, and subsequent posting, as simple as possible for the end user, a simple one page script, automatically collects the information when run in a web-browser and presents the user with the option to include or exclude any site sensitive information before "generating" the post [BB]code that can then be copied and simply pasted in to a new or existing forum post with no other interaction by the user required after posting.

#### Multilanguage Version
This multilanguage branch contains the scripts that create a single, multi language capable, file from a set of PHP files. 

How does it work ?

It basically scans the PHP code for translatable strings, creates or updates language files, and then builds everything into a single file.

Advantages:

* By providing language files in a standard language file format, things should become a bit easier for fellow translators.
* By splitting up the PHP code into several files it should become more maintainable.

This is a "**work in progress**" so let us know if you have questions or wish to help in some way.
